# Under Neon Lights Prototypes

Early prototypes that evolved into the interactive VR music video, [Under Neon Lights](https://jonobr1.github.io/neon-lights), produced by Within Unlimited Inc. Each html file is a self contained idea.

## Issues

+ iOS occasionally renders wrong camera or maybe it's a device orientation issue.
+ Annie collides with objects. Make objects "repel" her.
+ Add sky to the environment.
+ Fix rotation for device orientation (seems stuck in the y-rotation).
+ Start to think about overall and transitions between scenes.
+ Model Annie
+ Start to think about objects in other scenes.
+ What is the other "view" when Annie blinks?
